// Local events (want_create and want_close) received during the waiting for
// acknowledgement (states created and write_closed) are stored and should be
// retried afterwards by calling handleLocalEvent. Calling wantClose quickly
// after wantCreate will replace the pending state.
//
// See documentation of remoteControlEventType for more details.
//
// Note: there could potentially be a small timing issue after the remote
// create event is received and before the create_ack event is sent back to
// the remote node: the transport will be added to the room before the remote
// node adds the transport so it might start sending data to the remote node
// before the remote node is ready to receive the data. But if the create_ack
// is sent first and the transport immediately added to the room, this should
// be a very short period. It might be better to test this first and then
// optimize if necessary.
