# Contributing

Thank you for your interest to contribute to Peer Calls. By participating in
this project, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct].

  [code of conduct]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Everyone is expected to follow the code of conduct anywhere in the project
codebases, issue trackers and chatrooms.

## Notice

Before contributing, check the issue tracker and see if there is already an
issue about something you're trying to implement. Check if somebody else is
already assigned to the issue. It is recommended to *ask* or create an issue
before implementing changes - this way you'll have a lower chance that your
pull request will be rejected.

## Rules

 1. Do not include libraries or fonts from a CDN. All libraries must be bundled
    with the app, preferrably installed via NPM.
 2. Do not use APIs from third-party servers, like Google Maps or Slack.
 3. If a permission is needed, do not ask for it before explaining the need for
    it to the user. From [Google Web Fundamentals][gwf]:
    > Make sure that users understand why youâ€™re asking for their location, and
    > what the benefit to them will be. Asking for it immediately on the
    > homepage as the site loads results in a poor user experience.
    One exception is the camera/microphone access, because this application is
    useless without it.
 4. Write tests! A lot of work has been put to have a high test code coverage,
    and pull requests that decrease test coverage will be rejected.
 5. Do not include your personal development environment settings in this
    repository. Different people use different environments, and only generic
    settings like `.editorconfig` will be allowed.
 6. In order to accept a pull request, the CI must pass, and that includes
    the linter, all tests, and the build process.
